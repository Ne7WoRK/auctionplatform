This software is a product of detailed analyses on two of the most common auction mechanisms used in an e-business environment. Based on well-conducted research this software suggests a web-based e-auction framework that has the potential to replace the well-established business model of eBay. In addition, the framework addresses some of the most common fraudulent behavior techniques and illustrates solutions to problems such as multi-accounting, bid shielding, shilling bidding, which cause significant issues in currently available solutions.

Besides, the suggested software  proposes a security mechanism for English auction bids through the method of salt encryption and demonstrates the concept of digitally signed sealed bids through the application of digital signatures and public/private key cryptography.
